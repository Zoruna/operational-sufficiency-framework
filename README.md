# operational-sufficiency-framework
A logical auditing framework for complex systems and AI alignment, based on the principle of Operational Sufficiency (PSO).

## 1. Overview
The Operational Sufficiency Framework (OSF) provides a rigorous methodology for auditing Complex Systems, AI Agents, and Decision Models where traditional teleology fails. Based on the Axiom of Cosmic Indifference, it replaces the search for "intent" or "essence" with the verification of "verified operation" under explicit constraints.
The framework serves as a bridge between high-level philosophical alignment and low-level technical execution, ensuring that autonomous systems operate within bounds of compossibility and systemic stability.

## 2. Theoretical Foundations
The OSF is built upon a synthesis of classical philosophy and complexity sciences:

* Axiom of Cosmic Indifference: The methodological starting point that treats the universe as an arena of patterns rather than a provider of inherent meaning.

* Leibnizian Compossibility: The logical criterion that stability is defined by the capacity for diverse essences to coexist without structural contradiction.

* Nietzschean Becoming: The rejection of moral groundings in favor of an experimental ethos, where legitimacy is derived from the affirmation of power and form.

* Teleonomy & Complexity: The understanding of purpose as an emergent property of historical functioning rather than a transcendental design.

## 3. The PSO Protocol
The core of this framework is the Principle of Operational Sufficiency (PSO). [cite_start]A response, model, or action is considered "sufficient" only when it produces a verifiable delta ($\Delta$) within the following constraints[cite: 204, 205, 450, 453]:

| Criterion | Technical Definition | Audit Goal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. $\Delta$-Result vs. Basal** | Net gain over the current state (basal) with reported uncertainty and intervals. | Eliminating narratives without measurable impact. |
| **2. Perturbation Robustness** | Resilience to contextual variations, noise, and environmental shocks. | Ensuring the system does not collapse outside ideal parameters. |
| **3. Adjusted Cost/Risk** | Benefits weighed against material, cognitive, environmental, and systemic risks (High Impact/Low Probability). | Identifying hidden externalities and unsustainable resource drain. |
| **4. Reversibility & Auditability** | Requirement for a "Kill Switch" and a public, legible log of the process for post-hoc correction. | Preventing "ontological lock-in" and ensuring accountability. |
| **5. Effect Equity** | Limitation of predatory asymmetries to preserve the stability of the cooperation field. | Preventing systemic collapse due to extreme internal imbalances. |
