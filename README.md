# operational-sufficiency-framework
A logical auditing framework for complex systems and AI alignment, based on the principle of Operational Sufficiency.

## Operational Sufficiency Framework (OSF)
This framework provides a rigorous methodology for auditing Complex Systems, AI Agents, and Decision Models where traditional teleology fails. Based on the Axiom of Cosmic Indifference, it replaces "intent" with "verified operation".


### The PSO Protocol
The core of this framework is the Principle of Operational Sufficiency (PSO). A response is considered sufficient when it produces a verifiable delta within explicit constraints:
  1.  $\Delta$-Result vs Basal: Net gain over the current state with reported uncertainty.
  2.  Perturbation Robustness: Resilience to contextual variations and noise.
  3.  Adjusted Cost/Risk: Benefits weighed against material, cognitive, and systemic risks.
  4.  Reversibility & Auditability: Requirement for a "Kill Switch" and public log of the process.
  5.  Effect Equity: Limitation of predatory asymmetries to preserve systemic stability.

### Applied Domains
* Bio-Logical Hacking: Mapping agency in synthetic life forms (Xenobots/Anthrobots).
* Ontotechnical Governance: Designing non-closed systems in programmable environments.
